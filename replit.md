## Data Models

### Companies
- id, name, industry, website, notes

### Contacts
- id, companyId (FK), name, title, email, phone
- relationshipBase (baseball-themed: 1st base, 2nd base, 3rd base, homerun)
- reportsToId (FK to self for org hierarchy)
- lanes (array of shipping lanes)
- regions (array of geographic regions)
- freightSpend (annual freight spend in dollars)
- spotBiddingProcess (description of their bidding process)
- interests, notes

### RFPs (separate entity)
- id, companyId (FK), title, status (pending/submitted)
- value, dueDate, notes
- fileName, fileData (JSON: { rows[], highVolumeLanes[] } from Excel upload)
- laneCount, totalVolume, originStates[], destinationStates[]
- High-volume lanes (>50 annual shipments) are auto-extracted and stored in fileData.highVolumeLanes
- Each high-volume lane can have a `status` (open/contact_added/researched) and `contactId` stored in the fileData JSON

### Awards (separate entity)
- id, companyId (FK), title, value, awardDate
- lanes (array), notes
